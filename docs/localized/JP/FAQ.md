# Frequently Asked Questions


### Scripting Runtime Environment not setup correctly

If you haven't switched your scripting runtime version from .NET 3.5 to .NET 4.6 or .NET 4.x, you will see such error message:

```
error CS1061: Type `System.Text.StringBuilder' does not contain a definition for `Clear' and no extension method `Clear' of type `System.Text.StringBuilder' could be found. Are you missing an assembly reference?
```

This is because .NET 3.5 doesn't support method Clear() for StringBuilder, refer to [Setting Up The ML-Agents Toolkit Within Unity](Installation.md#setting-up-ml-agent-within-unity) for solution. 

### TensorFlowSharp flag not turned on. 

If you have already imported the TensorFlowSharp plugin, but havn't set ENABLE_TENSORFLOW flag for your scripting define symbols, you will see the following error message:

```
You need to install and enable the TensorFlowSharp plugin in order to use the internal brain. 
```

This error message occurs because the TensorFlowSharp plugin won't be usage without the ENABLE_TENSORFLOW flag, refer to [Setting Up The ML-Agents Toolkit Within Unity](Installation.md#setting-up-ml-agent-within-unity) for solution. 

### Tensorflow epsilon placeholder error

If you have a graph placeholder set in the internal Brain inspector that is not present in the TensorFlow graph, you will see some error like this:

```
UnityAgentsException: One of the Tensorflow placeholder could not be found. In brain <some_brain_name>, there are no FloatingPoint placeholder named <some_placeholder_name>. 
```

Solution: Go to all of your Brain object, find `Graph placeholders` and change its `size` to 0 to remove the `epsilon` placeholder. 

Similarly, if you have a graph scope set in the internal Brain inspector that is not correctly set, you will see some error like this:

```
UnityAgentsException: The node <Wrong_Graph_Scope>/action could not be found. Please make sure the graphScope <Wrong_Graph_Scope>/ is correct
```

Solution: Make sure your Graph Scope field matches the corresponding brain object name in your Hierachy Inspector when there is multiple brain. 

### Environment Permission Error

If you directly import your Unity environment without building it in the 
editor, you might need to give it additional permissions to execute it. 

If you receive such a permission error on macOS, run:

`chmod -R 755 *.app` 

or on Linux:

`chmod -R 755 *.x86_64` 

On Windows, you can find 
[instructions](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754344(v=ws.11).aspx).

### Environment Connection Timeout

If you are able to launch the environment from `UnityEnvironment` but 
then receive a timeout error, there may be a number of possible causes.
 * _Cause_: There may be no Brains in your environment which are set 
 to `External`.  In this case, the environment will not attempt to 
 communicate with python. _Solution_: Set the Brains(s) you wish to 
 externally control through the Python API to `External` from the 
 Unity Editor, and rebuild the environment.
 * _Cause_: On OSX, the firewall may be preventing communication with 
 the environment. _Solution_: Add the built environment binary to the 
 list of exceptions on the firewall by following 
 [instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201642). 
 * _Cause_: An error happened in the Unity Environment preventing 
 communication. _Solution_: Look into the 
 [log files](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LogFiles.html) 
 generated by the Unity Environment to figure what error happened. 

### Communication port {} still in use

If you receive an exception `"Couldn't launch new environment because 
communication port {} is still in use. "`, you can change the worker 
number in the Python script when calling 

`UnityEnvironment(file_name=filename, worker_id=X)`

### Mean reward : nan

If you receive a message `Mean reward : nan` when attempting to train a 
model using PPO, this is due to the episodes of the learning environment 
not terminating. In order to address this, set `Max Steps` for either 
the Academy or Agents within the Scene Inspector to a value greater 
than 0. Alternatively, it is possible to manually set `done` conditions 
for episodes from within scripts for custom episode-terminating events.
