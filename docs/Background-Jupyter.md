# Background: Jupyter

[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) is a fantastic tool for writing code with
embedded visualizations. We provide one such notebook,
`notebooks/getting-started.ipynb`, for testing the Python control interface to a
Unity build. This notebook is introduced in the
[Getting Started Guide](Getting-Started.md)
tutorial, but can be used for testing the connection to any Unity build.

For a walkthrough of how to use Jupyter, see
[Running the Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html)
in the _Jupyter/IPython Quick Start Guide_. To launch Jupyter, run in the
command line:

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

Then navigate to `localhost:8888` to access your notebooks.
