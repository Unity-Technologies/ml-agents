# Jupyter

[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) is a fantastic tool for writing code with embedded visualizations. 
We provide several such notebooks for testing your Python installation and 
training behaviors. For a walkthrough of how to use Jupyter, see
[Running the Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html)
in the _Jupyter/IPython Quick Start Guide_.

To launch Jupyter, run in the command line:

`jupyter notebook`

Then navigate to `localhost:8888` to access the notebooks.
