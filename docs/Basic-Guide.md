# Basic Guide

This guide will show you how to use a pre-trained model in an example Unity
environment (3D Ball) and show you how to train the model yourself.

If you are not familiar with the [Unity Engine](https://unity3d.com/unity), we
highly recommend the [Roll-a-ball
tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/roll-ball-tutorial) to learn all
the basic concepts of Unity.

## Setting up the ML-Agents Toolkit within Unity

In order to use the ML-Agents toolkit within Unity, you first need to change a few
Unity settings.

1. Launch Unity
2. On the Projects dialog, choose the **Open** option at the top of the window.
3. Using the file dialog that opens, locate the `UnitySDK` folder
   within the ML-Agents toolkit project and click **Open**.
4. Go to **Edit** > **Project Settings** > **Player**
5. For **each** of the platforms you target (**PC, Mac and Linux Standalone**,
   **iOS** or **Android**):
    1. Expand the **Other Settings** section.
    2. Select **Scripting Runtime Version** to **Experimental (.NET 4.6
       Equivalent or .NET 4.x Equivalent)**
6. Go to **File** > **Save Project**

## Running a Pre-trained Model

We include pre-trained models for our agents (`.nn` files) and we use the
[Unity Inference Engine](Unity-Inference-Engine.md) to run these models
inside Unity. In this section, we will use the pre-trained model for the
3D Ball example.

1. In the **Project** window, go to the `Assets/ML-Agents/Examples/3DBall/Scenes` folder
   and open the `3DBall` scene file.
2. In the **Project** window, go to the `Assets/ML-Agents/Examples/3DBall/Prefabs` folder.
   Expand `3DBall` and click on the `Agent` prefab.  You should see the `Agent` prefab in the **Inspector** window.

   **Note**: The platforms in the `3DBall` scene were created using the `3DBall` prefab.  Instead of updating all 12 platforms individually, you can update the `3DBall` prefab instead.

   ![Platform Prefab](images/platform_prefab.png)

3. In the **Project** window, drag the **3DBallLearning** Model located in
   `Assets/ML-Agents/Examples/3DBall/TFModels` into the `Model` property under `Ball 3D Agent (Script)` component in the **Inspector** window.

   ![3dball learning brain](images/3dball_learning_brain.png)

4. You should notice that each `Agent` under each `3DBall` in the **Hierarchy** windows now contains **3DBallLearning** as `Model`. __Note__ : You can modify multiple game objects in a scene by selecting them all at
   once using the search bar in the Scene Hierarchy.
8. Select the **InferenceDevice** to use for this model (CPU or GPU) on the Agent.
   _Note: CPU is faster for the majority of ML-Agents toolkit generated models_
9. Click the **Play** button and you will see the platforms balance the balls
   using the pre-trained model.

## Using the Basics Jupyter Notebook

The `notebooks/getting-started.ipynb` [Jupyter notebook](Background-Jupyter.md)
contains a simple walk-through of the functionality of the Python API. It can
also serve as a simple test that your environment is configured correctly.
Within `Basics`, be sure to set `env_name` to the name of the Unity executable
if you want to [use an executable](Learning-Environment-Executable.md) or to
`None` if you want to interact with the current scene in the Unity Editor.

More information and documentation is provided in the
[Python API](Python-API.md) page.

## Training the Model with Reinforcement Learning

### Setting up the environment for training

In order to setup the Agents for Training, you will need to edit the
`Behavior Name` under `BehaviorParamters` in the Agent Inspector window.
The `Behavior Name` is used to group agents per behaviors. Note that Agents
sharing the same `Behavior Name` must be agents of the same type using the
same `Behavior Parameters`. You can make sure all your agents have the same
`Behavior Parameters` using Prefabs.
The `Behavior Name` corresponds to the name of the model that will be
generated by the training process and is used to select the hyperparameters
from the training configuration file.

### Training the environment

1. Open a command or terminal window.
2. Navigate to the folder where you cloned the ML-Agents toolkit repository.
   **Note**: If you followed the default [installation](Installation.md), then
   you should be able to run `mlagents-learn` from any directory.
3. Run `mlagents-learn <trainer-config-path> --run-id=<run-identifier> --train`
   where:
    - `<trainer-config-path>` is the relative or absolute filepath of the
      trainer configuration. The defaults used by example environments included
      in `MLAgentsSDK` can be found in `config/trainer_config.yaml`.
    - `<run-identifier>` is a string used to separate the results of different
      training runs
    - `--train` tells `mlagents-learn` to run a training session (rather
      than inference)
4. If you cloned the ML-Agents repo, then you can simply run

      ```sh
      mlagents-learn config/trainer_config.yaml --run-id=firstRun --train
      ```

5. When the message _"Start training by pressing the Play button in the Unity
   Editor"_ is displayed on the screen, you can press the :arrow_forward: button
   in Unity to start training in the Editor.

   **Note**: Alternatively, you can use an executable rather than the Editor to
perform training. Please refer to [this
page](Learning-Environment-Executable.md) for instructions on how to build and
use an executable.

```console
ml-agents$ mlagents-learn config/trainer_config.yaml --run-id=first-run --train

### After training

You can press Ctrl+C to stop the training, and your trained model will be at
`models/<run-identifier>/<behavior_name>.nn` where
`<behavior_name>` is the name of the `Behavior Name` of the agents corresponding to the model.
(**Note:** There is a known bug on Windows that causes the saving of the model to
fail when you early terminate the training, it's recommended to wait until Step
has reached the max_steps parameter you set in trainer_config.yaml.) This file
corresponds to your model's latest checkpoint. You can now embed this trained
model into your Agents by following the steps below, which is similar to
the steps described
[above](#running-a-pre-trained-model).

1. Move your model file into
   `UnitySDK/Assets/ML-Agents/Examples/3DBall/TFModels/`.
2. Open the Unity Editor, and select the **3DBall** scene as described above.
3. Select the  **3DBall** prefab Agent object.
4. Drag the `<behavior_name>.nn` file from the Project window of
   the Editor to the **Model** placeholder in the **Ball3DAgent**
   inspector window.
5. Press the :arrow_forward: button at the top of the Editor.
