## Translations

To make the Unity ML-Agents Toolkit accessible to the global research and Unity
developer communities, we're attempting to create and maintain translations of
our documentation. We've started with translating a subset of the documentation
to one language (Chinese), but we hope to continue translating more pages and to
other languages. Consequently, we welcome any enhancements and improvements from
the community.

## Deprecated Docs

We no longer use them ourselves and so they may not be up-to-date. We've decided
to keep them up just in case they are helpful to you.
