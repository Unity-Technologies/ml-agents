    # package, this name will be registered for you. It will determine how
    # users can install this project, e.g.:
    #
    # $ pip install sampleproject
    #
    # And where it will live on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/sampleproject/

    # For example, the following would provide a command called `sample` which
    # executes the function `main` from this package when invoked:
