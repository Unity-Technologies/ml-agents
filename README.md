# Unity ML Agents (Beta)

**Unity Machine Learning Agents** (ML Agents) is an open-source 
Unity plugin that enables games and 
simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents.
Agents can be trained using reinforcement learning, imitation
learning, neuroevolution, or other machine learning methods through
a simple-to-use Python API. We also provide implementations (based 
on TensorFlow) for several state-of-the-art algorithms to enable game 
developers and hobbyists to easily train intelligent agents for 2D, 
3D and VR/AR games. These trained agents could then be leveraged in 
multiple scenarios, including controlling NPC behavior (in a variety 
of settings such as multi-agent and adversarial), automated testing 
of game builds and evaluating different game design decisions 
pre-release. ML Agents is mutually beneficial for both game developers 
and AI researchers as it provides a central platform where advances in 
AI can be evaluated on Unity’s rich environments and then made accessible
to the wider research and game developer communities. 

## Features
