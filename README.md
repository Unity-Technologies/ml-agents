**The Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit** (ML-Agents) is an open-source
Unity plugin that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for
training intelligent agents. Agents can be trained using reinforcement learning,
imitation learning, neuroevolution, or other machine learning methods through a
simple-to-use Python API. We also provide implementations (based on TensorFlow)
of state-of-the-art algorithms to enable game developers and hobbyists to easily
train intelligent agents for 2D, 3D and VR/AR games. These trained agents can be
used for multiple purposes, including controlling NPC behavior (in a variety of
settings such as multi-agent and adversarial), automated testing of game builds
and evaluating different game design decisions pre-release. The ML-Agents
toolkit is mutually beneficial for both game developers and AI researchers as it
provides a central platform where advances in AI can be evaluated on Unity’s
rich environments and then made accessible to the wider research and game
developer communities.

## Features

* Unity environment control from Python
* 10+ sample Unity environments
* Two deep reinforcement learning algorithms, [Proximal Policy Optimization](docs/Training-PPO.md) (PPO) and [Soft Actor-Critic](docs/Training-SAC.md) (SAC)
* Support for multiple environment configurations and training scenarios
* Train memory-enhanced agents using deep reinforcement learning
* Easily definable Curriculum Learning and Generalization scenarios
* Built-in support for Imitation Learning
* Flexible agent control with On Demand Decision Making
* Visualizing network outputs within the environment
* Simplified set-up with Docker
* Wrap learning environments as a gym
* Utilizes the Unity Inference Engine
* Train using concurrent Unity environment instances

## Documentation

* For more information, in addition to installation and usage instructions, see
  our [documentation home](docs/Readme.md).
* If you are a researcher interested in a discussion of Unity as an AI platform, see a pre-print of our [reference paper on Unity and the ML-Agents Toolkit](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02627). Also, see below for instructions on citing this paper.
* If you have used an earlier version of the ML-Agents toolkit, we strongly
  recommend our [guide on migrating from earlier versions](docs/Migrating.md).

## Translations

To make the Unity ML-Agents toolkit accessible to the global research and
Unity developer communities, we're attempting to create and maintain
translations of our documentation. We've started with translating a subset
of the documentation to one language (Chinese), but we hope to continue
translating more pages and to other languages. Consequently,
we welcome any enhancements and improvements from the community.
